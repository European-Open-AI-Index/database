    notes: Repository offers a large amount of fairly well-organized code for data curation and model

# documentation:
code:
    class: partial
    link: https://github.com/imoneoi/openchat/tree/master/ochat
    notes: There is plenty of code in the github repository but only some of it is documented

architecture:
    class: open
    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11235
    notes: Architecture quite well described in preprint

preprint:
    class: open
    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11235
    notes: Preprint describes the model architecture and instruction tuning approach, though is hampered by building on notoriously closed Llama2
