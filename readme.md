# How to contribute 

Every project is a separate yaml file. The first few fields contain basic metadata about the model, the rest of the file is a set of triples of `_class`, `_link` and `_notes`. Class can be one of three values: ðŸŸ© open, ðŸŸ§ partial or ðŸŸ¥ closed (leave empty to signify NA). Link is a URL providing evidence for the openness classification. Notes provide context and reasoning for the classification.

# Openness Criteria and system information
For each model, the yaml files in this database collect (1)some general information about the system, (2) about the organization behind it, (2) and about 14 dimension of openness. The below list spells out for the openness criteria for features in the areas of system information and organisation, followed by openness criteria groupt into 'Availability', 'Documentation' and 'Access'. Use these guidelines to document determinations of openness levels as precisely as possible, including links to evidence. Notes are optional.

## **System**

    name: Name of the model including eventual version number or size indication, e.g. Llama 3.1 or Olmo-7B-instruct
    
    link: Link to official model publisher website or, if that does not exist, platform hosting the model.

    type: Model type in one word, e.g. text, video, audio. Multiple keywords possible.
    
    basemodelname: If applicable, name of base model ("foundation model") that was used.

    endmodelname: Name of the model the enduser interacts with.
    
    endmodellicense: License that applies to enduser interaction with the model.

    releasedate: Earliest release date of the model through any offical source, in YYYY MMM format, e.g. 2024 NOV.

## **Organisation**

    name:  Organisation that released the model. Usually synonymous with model builder.

    link: Link to offical source of information about model release, e.g. offical website or blog.
