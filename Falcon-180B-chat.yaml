    class: partial
    link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/tiiuae/falcon-refinedweb
    notes: From the documentation 'The key ingredient for the high quality of the Falcon models is their training data, predominantly based (>80%) on RefinedWeb — a novel massive web dataset based on CommonCrawl' (https://huggingface.co/blog/falcon). However, only a small sample is made available.

datasources_endmodel:
    class: partial
    link: https://github.com/project-baize/baize-chatbot
    notes: No details provided beyond "finetuned on a mixture of Ultrachat, Platypus and Airoboros".

    class: closed

    notes: No source code shared anywhere. The over 200 github repositories of TII appear to include no LLM or Falcon related code.

# documentation
code:
    class: closed
    link:
    notes: No code available, so no code documented.

architecture:
    class: partial
    link: https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-180B-chat#model-architecture-and-objective
    notes: Architecture described as  "causal decoder-only" and "optimized for inference", but very few details available.

    link: 
        - https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01116
        - https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16867
    notes: First preprint covers the creation and curation of RefinedWeb dataset, but not other aspects of the model. The second preprint provides more details about the model architecture, implementation, evaluation results, and limitations.

    class: closed

    notes: No peer-reviewed paper known; HuggingFace repository says "coming soon".

        - https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16867
    notes: Model card on HuggingFace is mostly used to advertise the model, not to document its training and evaluation details. However, the preprint has a "Model card" section where these details are presented.

datasheet:
    class: open
    link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01116
    notes: The preprint on RefinedWeb dataset presents a datasheet in a section named "RefinedWeb Datasheet", which goes into quite a bit of detail on collection, preprocessing etc.
